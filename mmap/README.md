Implementation: 
	As far as I know, everything has been correctly implemented. On some refreshes of the page, nothing seems to load, I am not sure why that is (it doesn't look like there are errors, no calls are made at all, it's like the program isn't being run).

Hours:
	approximately 10 hours 

Fun Notes:
	Added in ability to click a character's name in the sidebar and have the map go to their location
