Is it possible to request real-time data from MBTA using XMLHttpRequest?:
I actually was able to do this no problem, when I was using Safari. 
However, when I switched to Chrome, I got this error:
"The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://www.mbta.com' that is not equal to the supplied origin. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access."
